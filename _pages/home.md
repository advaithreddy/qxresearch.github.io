  About
</p>

qxresearch AI is a research lab focused on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. Our team aspires to make discoveries that hold a broad impact, and at the core of our approach lies the sharing of our findings in the field. Our researchers consistently contribute to academic journals, share their projects as open-source on GitHub, and implement these discoveries in tangible AI applications within the realms of Healthcare and Education.

As an organization, we curate a portfolio of research projects and papers driven by fundamental research, real-life applications, and infrastructure goals. We provide individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific research types. Our primary research focus resides in the domains of `Generative AI`, `Computer Vision`, `Reinforcement Learning`. Our dynamic team comprises a diverse group of dedicated individuals who bring a wealth of experience from some of the most influential tech giants in the industry. Hailing from esteemed organizations such as `IBM`, `Mindtree`, `Intel Labs` and `Amazon`, our professionals infuse their industry insights into every facet of our research projects.

But that's not all â€“ we're also proud to host a vibrant blend of academic brilliance. Our team is enriched by the contributions of exceptional students pursuing their Masters and Bachelors degrees from prestigious institutions like `IIT`s, `NIT`s, `VIT`, `ISI`, and `IISc`. This fusion of industry expertise and academic rigor forms the backbone of our lab's pursuit of cutting-edge AI advancements.

In the past few years, the field of computing has expanded significantly, gaining importance in society. Similarly, our research has become more intricate and accurate. Our approach to research has always been flexible; some projects extend beyond the formal definition of research and are done for fun. We're dedicated to assisting developers and researchers from around the world.
