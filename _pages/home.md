  About
</p>

qxresearch AI is a research lab focused on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. Our team aspires to make discoveries that hold a broad impact, and at the core of our approach lies the sharing of our findings in the field. Our researchers regularly publish in academic journals, release projects as open source on GitHub, and apply these findings in practical applications.

As an organization, we curate a portfolio of research projects and papers driven by fundamental research, real-life applications, and infrastructure goals. We provide individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific research types. Our influence spans diverse fields such as App and Web development.

In the past few years, the field of computing has expanded significantly, gaining importance in society. Similarly, our research has become more intricate and accurate. Our approach to research has always been flexible; some projects extend beyond the formal definition of research and are done for fun. We're dedicated to assisting developers and researchers from around the world âš¡

At qxresearch AI, we are passionate about fostering the next generation of computer scientists and researchers. We firmly believe that empowering young minds with knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning will shape a brighter future for technology and society as a whole. As part of our commitment to education and knowledge-sharing, we are thrilled to introduce our personalized 1-to-1 `Python`, `Data Structures` and `Machine Learning` Sessions designed specifically for students. 

The course aims to enhance students' problem-solving abilities through intensive interaction with `LeetCode` questions. Additionally, it concludes with students undertaking a substantial Python-based project, contributing to the holistic achievement of this objective. Our trainers possess extensive experience collaborating with prominent industry leaders such as `IBM`, `Intel`,`Mindtree` etc.
