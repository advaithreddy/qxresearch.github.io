  <b>Research @qxresearch AI</b>
</p>

qxresearch AI is at the forefront of innovation in Machine Intelligence, with active research exploring virtually all aspects of `Machine Learning`, including `Deep Learning` and `Computer Vision`. Exploring theory as well as application, much of our work on language, speech, translation, visual processing, ranking and prediction relies on Machine Intelligence. In all of those tasks and many others, we gather large volumes of direct or indirect evidence of relationships of interest, applying learning algorithms to understand and generalize.

1. Face Mesh

MediaPipe Face Mesh is a face geometry solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D surface geometry, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor. Utilizing lightweight model architectures together with GPU acceleration throughout the pipeline, the solution delivers real-time performance critical for live experiences.

Using mediapipe we will estimate 468 face landmarks in live video, which could be really helpful in AR effects utilizing facial surface geometry and face recognition. In the demo website you'll be able to see your unique facial landmarks. In this project we've also used partial static image to discovere as much landmarks as possible.

1. 10 Lines of Code

In this project we will develope some `Python` projects with only 10 lines of code to solve real life probelms. With the word `problems` I mean problems we face each day : like merge multiple pdf offline, protech your pdf with a curstom password, windows notificitation etc which will help you `developers` make your own unique project.
