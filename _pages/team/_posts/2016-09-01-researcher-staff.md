I am currently in my third year pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science @UEMKolkata. I found Machine Learning and Computer Vision really intriguing because it gives computer brain and eye(sort of). Now, I'm in an internship as Machine Learning researcher @NLP AI Automation.

I'm the founder of this ML project based organization @qxresearch, where we're working on new problem statements and help other developer to get started in this domain.
