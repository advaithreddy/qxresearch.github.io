We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and gritâ€”especially Machine Learning enthusiasts. Here are some projects that we're currently working on. Feel free to add or work on a different project that interests you.

#### **Cryptographically secured random number generator using GAN**

The Cryptographically Secured Random Number Generator (CSRNG) project explores the innovative fusion of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with cryptographic principles to create a robust and unpredictable source of random numbers. Random number generation plays a crucial role in various domains, such as cryptography, secure communication, and digital signatures. Traditional random number generators can be vulnerable to attacks and biases, compromising the overall security of systems that rely on randomness.

- **Objective:** Develop a robust random number generator for enhanced security applications.
- **Approach:** Utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate cryptographically secure random numbers.
- **Advantage:** GANs introduce complexity and unpredictability, making the generated numbers resistant to attacks and biases.
- **Integration:** Combine GANs with cryptographic principles for rigorous testing and validation.
- **Impact:** Enhance security in cryptography, digital signatures, and secure communication channels.
- **Outcome:** Advancement in secure random number generation methods with potential for widespread application.

#### **Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging**

Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging focuses on developing a sophisticated system for identifying anomalies within medical images. By leveraging the capabilities of generative models, this project aims to enhance disease detection by analyzing deviations from healthy image distributions.

- **Objective:** Create a system capable of detecting anomalies in medical images, aiding in early disease detection.
- **Approach:** Train a generative model on a dataset of healthy images to learn the underlying distribution. Analyze the model's latent space for outliers and deviations.
- **Advantage:** Utilizes generative models to capture complex patterns and variations in medical images.
- **Application:** Early detection of diseases by identifying subtle deviations from the norm in medical imagery.
- **Potential Impact:** Improve patient outcomes through early intervention and treatment.
